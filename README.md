Hello!

To use this plugin, simply add it to your Unreal Engines directory for "plugins". 

Once added:
1 - run unreal
2 - create a new project (I used the 3rd person unreal demo)
3 - open the BP for the player character
4 - add the component "AC_DynamicReverb"
5 - select the assets in the plugins content folder for the data asset and float curve in the AC settings
6 - search for "Room size" and "Absorption value" from the AC_DynamicReverb in the bp graph
7 - connect these to your middle ware of choice!
